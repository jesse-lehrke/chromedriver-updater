# Chromedriver Updater

Checks current version of Chromedriver and ensures it is the correct version for the version of Chrome installed on a Windows computer.

If version is not correct, downloads correct version of Chrome into current directory and cleans up.

Creates a version.txt document to assist in this process.

Import and run function at start of programme.

Designed to be put in a python executable run by average user (e.g. a Selenium based application for searching websites automatically).

Does not use beautiful soup in order to reduce size of executable.

Print functions not needed in final distributed version.

# About me
